# ARRuler
> A simple iOS app which measures real-world distances using ARKit and Augmented Reality.

ARRuler allows you to measure distances using augmented reality. Shockingly, this app was developed before Apple added a measurement feature to the operating system. The code is written in a way in which any developer can easily follow, and if you'd like, you can contact me with any questions you might have :)
